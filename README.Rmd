# `writethat`

## TLDR

1. install package
2. read showcase [https://thmshrt.github.io/writethat/]

## Motivation {-}

Package development in R can be tricky. For new developers, it is not obvious 
where to place the title of your documentation, the description of your documentation, or
`@import` for that matter. Misplacement can result in warnings and notes that 
delay the publishing of a package to CRAN in addition to being frustrating to 
debug. In addition the format of documentation is not always conducive to developing.
For instance `@examples` must be placed before a function. `writethat` looks to 
address a few of these issues as it expands its scope.

## Installation {-}

`writethat` will be available in CRAN as soon as it is approved

```r
install.packages('writethat')
```

For now `writethat` can be installed from github using

```r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github('thmshrt/writethat')
```
