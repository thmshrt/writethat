[["index.html", "Rapid Development with writethat About Motivation Installation", " Rapid Development with writethat Thomas Hart About Motivation Package development in R can be tricky. For new developers, it is not obvious where to place the titel of your documentation, the description of your documentation, or @import for that matter. This can produce warnings and notes while checking a package before submitting it to CRAN that are time consuming to fix. In addition the format of documentation is not always conducive to developing. For instance @examples must be placed after a function. writethat looks to address a few of these issues as it expands its scope. Installation writethat will be available in CRAN as soon as it is approved install.packages(&#39;writethat&#39;) For now writethat can be installed from github using library(devtools) devtools::install_github(&#39;thmshrt/writethat&#39;) "]]
